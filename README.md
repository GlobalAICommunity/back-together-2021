# Global AI Back together - October 2021

*In this GitHub repository you find all the information around the Global AI Back Together event.*

```We are thrilled that the world is opening up and couldn't be more happy to once again be Back Together and spend an evening of learning about AI together.


### Dates
Tuesday 19 October 2021   
Wednesday 20 October 2021   
Thursday 21 October 2021

### Event format
The event is all about being together, in-person or virtual, to learn about everything about Artificial intelligence. Every organizer is free to create a Back Together event to their liking, whether you want to have sessions, round tables, panels or workshops. 

We ***suggest*** for the event, in the spirit of being and learning together, that you run one of the two provided workshops in the evening for around 2-3 hours and start the event with a global keynote. This can either be in a virtual venue, for online workshops we recommand using Teams or in-person.
