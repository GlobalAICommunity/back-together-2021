### Event format
The event is all about being together, in-person or virtual, to learn about everything about Artificial intelligence. Every organizer is free to create a Back Together event to their liking, whether you want to have sessions, round tables, panels or workshops. 

We ***suggest*** for the event, in the spirit of being and learning together, that you run one of the two provided workshops in the evening for around 2-3 hours and start the event with a global keynote. This can either be in a virtual venue, for online workshops we recommand using Teams or in-person.

### Workshops / Hands-on Labs / Presentations


#### Workshop 1: The Azure Function that can see
Could have imagined a few years ago that you would be able to create an Azure Function that can tell you what is on your images? Good news, this is now possible with a few lines of code and some sample images.
In this hands-on lab you are going to train a ONNX classification Model with the Custom Vision service that will run in an Azure Function. The language of choice is Python and you will use Visual Studio code as the editor and the Azure CLI to manage and create your Azure Resources.
At the end of the lab you have a serverless API that can classify Images and learned about how to use the Azure Custom Vision Python SDK to train an ONNX model.
